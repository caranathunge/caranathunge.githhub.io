Hi! My name is Chathurani Ranathunge. I am a bioinformatics scientist with over a decade of experience in working with multiple types of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data. I was once a wet lab scientist and my journey into bioinformatics started when I fell in love with the puzzle-solving nature of analyzing biological data. Iâ€™m passionate about turning biological data into meaningful insights that can drive research forward.
